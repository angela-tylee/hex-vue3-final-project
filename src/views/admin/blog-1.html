<h3>Origins of Quiche:</h3>
<p>The roots of quiche can be traced back to medieval Germany, where bakers in the kingdom of Lothringen (modern-day
  Lorraine) created a savory pie known as ""kuchen,"" meaning cake. This early version of quiche consisted of a pastry
  crust filled with a mixture of eggs, cream, and whatever ingredients were locally available, such as vegetables,
  meats, and cheeses.</p>

<h3>Evolution in France:</h3>
<p>Quiche gained popularity in France during the 16th century when it became a staple in the region of Lorraine. The
  dish underwent further refinement, with the addition of ingredients like bacon, onions, and Gruyère cheese. The term
  ""quiche"" itself is derived from the German word ""kuchen,"" meaning cake, which evolved into ""kische"" in the
  Lorraine dialect and eventually became ""quiche"" as it entered the French culinary lexicon.</p>

Quiche became associated with French cuisine and was served at lavish banquets hosted by aristocrats and royalty.
However, it wasn't until the 19th century that quiche gained widespread popularity beyond the borders of Lorraine. The
publication of recipe books and the proliferation of cafes and bistros in Paris helped propel quiche into the culinary
spotlight, making it a beloved dish across France and eventually the world.

<h3>Global Appeal:</h3>

<h3>鹹派的起源：</h3>
<p>鹹派的根源可以追溯到中世紀的德國，當時洛林王國（今日的洛林）的烘焙師傅創造了一種名為“庫琴（kuchen）”的鹹派。這種早期版本的鹹派由麵皮製成，填入蛋、奶油和當地的食材，如蔬菜、肉類和奶酪。</p>
<h3>法國的演變：</h3>
<p>
  鹹派在16世紀時開始在法國流行起來，成為洛林地區的一道標誌性菜餚。鹹派經過進一步的改良，添加了培根、洋蔥和格呂耶爾奶酪等食材。鹹派這個名詞本身來源於德語詞彙“kuchen”，意為蛋糕，在洛林方言中演變成“kische”，最終進入法國烹飪詞彙成為“quiche”。
</p>
<p>鹹派開始與法國烹飪文化聯繫在一起，成為貴族和皇室豪華宴會上的必備佳餚。然而，直到19世紀，鹹派才在洛林以外地區廣受歡迎。烹飪食譜的出版以及巴黎咖啡館和小酒館的增加，推動著鹹派走向了烹飪的舞台，使其成為了法國乃至全世界喜愛的菜餚。

<h3>全吸引力：</h3>

  Child），她將法國烹飪技巧介紹給了全球觀眾。她的暢銷烹飪書《法國烹飪的藝術》中收錄了鹹派洛林的食譜，使數百萬家庭廚師接觸到了這道經典美食。</p>
<p>鹹派的多功能性和適應性進一步增加了其在全球的吸引力。從傳統的鹹派洛林到創意菜式，如菠菜、蘑菇和海鮮，鹹派已經成為了世界各地廚房的愛餐之選。</p>
